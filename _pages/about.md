Hi~ I am Fanzhi Lu(陆繁祉), a senior undergraduate student in Physics at [Zhili College, Tsinghua University](https://www.zlc.tsinghua.edu.cn/). Here is my [CV](\files\CV_Fanzhi_Lu_2.pdf).

Currently, I am an undergraduate member in [TSAIL Group](https://ml.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/) in [Department of Computer Science and Technology, Tsinghua University](https://www.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/), fortunate to be supervised by Prof. [Hang Su](https://www.suhangss.me/) and Prof. [Jun Zhu](https://ml.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/~jun/index.shtml).

My research interest lies in the intersection of physical science and machine learning, namely SciML and AI4Science. I am particularly enthusiastic about infusing physical priors into machine learning models to accelerate scientific discovery.

Feel free to reach out if you are interested in my research or me!
